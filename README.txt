 By submitting this file, I hereby declare that I (or our team of two) worked individually on this assignment
and wrote all of this code. I/we have listed all external resoures (web pages, books) used below. I/we have
listed all people with whom I/we have had significant discussions about the project below.

We implemented the following:
1."U" - Body tilt up while the back legs stay still.
2."E" - Body tilt down while the back legs stay still.
3. "H" - The head with the nose and tentacles will rotate to the right, pivoting the joint connecting the head and the body.
4."G" - See above except rotating to the left
5."T" - Tails will rotate to the right; We purposely set the pivoting point to the inner of the body because the back body of our mole is curved.
6."V" - See above except rotating to the right.
7."N" - The 22 nose tentacles will move radially forrwards together(fans). When clicking again, move to the original gesture.
8. "S" - First clik on "S" will make
(1) the front left leg and the back right leg rotate forwards
(2) head  moves to the right
(3) tail moves to the left
(4) nose fan out
Second click on "S" will make
(1) the front left leg and back right leg returns to their original position
(2) the front right leg and back left leg will rotate forwards
(3) head moves to the left
(4) tail moves to the right
(5) nose flips
Third hit on "S" will bring everything back to their original position.
9. "D" - Two front paws will rotate downwards while the claws will roate downward more, pivoting the joint connecting paws and claws.

extra credits for animations:(2/3)
10. "W" - walking: one hit will make legs move and second hit will make legs move opposite direction; the third hit will reset mole to original position.
11. "I" - rotation of the front left paw and back right paw
12. "P" - rotation of the fromt right par and back left paw
13. All animation will reset before another animation fires.
extra credits for modelling:(2/2)
14. We make the body and the tail of mole look more "curved" use hundreds of 4*4 Matrix and we apply animation to  all of those matrices as well.


(we think it worth 2 points)
